Muntaj Begum, Senior Executive, Payroll and Claims

I am a payroll specialist in VITAL. Payroll work can be complex and demanding at times, but I am glad that I have strong support from colleagues who are like family.

As a specialist with many years of payroll experience, I frequently conduct training to share my insights with younger colleagues who have just joined the team. This gives me great satisfaction and motivation!

I am also grateful for the opportunities provided by VITAL. Over the years, I have received recognition for my contributions. These include the National Day Award for Efficiency, VITAL Services Ambassador Award and Long Service Award.
