VITAL works with businesses and service providers to co-create and offer corporate services solutions to government agencies. Here are areas where your company can partner us.

### Demand Aggregation
Every year, over 30,000 purchases are made by public agencies through our public service-wide Demand Aggregation (DA) contracts for common goods and services.

Covering a wide range of goods and services, these contracts allow government agencies to make collective purchases and achieve economies of scale.

VITAL is one of the lead agencies for public sector DA and manages the following DA contracts:
* AV Equipment and Accessories
* Electronics & Electrical Appliances
* Warrants of Arrest Execution
* Temporary and Permanent Employee
* Postage Paid Envelopes

We are constantly on the lookout for new opportunities to aggregate demand across the public sector, and welcome suppliers as well as service providers who wish to offer their goods and services.
